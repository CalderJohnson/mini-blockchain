# mini-blockchain

This is a model blockchain, illustrating how cryptocurrencies work!
It has the ability to track and upload any number of transactions. 
I'm currently writing an implementation of the RSA cryptographic algorithm in C++
to create security on the model blockchain (ie signing and verifying transactions via mining).
